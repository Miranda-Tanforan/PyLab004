I had so much fun with this!
I'd like to first point out that the final scene you asked for is in deliverable.py
lab04_scratch.py was my first attempt in lab, it changed alot over the last couple days and ended up confusing my brain too much.
So I decided to do it AGAIN. Which is found in lab04_AGAIN. I took some extra liberty with that one.

On my first go, my instinct was to use integers and plot everything by hand. 
I ran into trouble when I saw how time consuming it is to punch in new numbers EVERYWHERE, and still have things in the wrong place.
You can see some of that in my scratch file.

Then I remember back to class how you were putting the parameter requirements in relation to one another. And copied/applied it to my own functions.
It wasn't something that would have likely taken awhile for me to come up with on my own. So thank you for sharing examples.
While it was annoying to have to do it all over again, I learned the hard way how empowering generalization is for functions. 
And I'm not likely to forget it anytime soon.

Encapsulation made the executable part of the file so simple to read, and less likely for human error to occur. 
Looking at the script, technically I could make a similar scene to the one I created by not defining any new functions. 
But it would be a nightmare to look at, and also difficult to diagnose where something went wrong. And as soon as you 
move anything out of order the system is broken. 

Creating bite sized, generalized functions to complete the project made it so much easier on me.
